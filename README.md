🚀 PDC Project: Parallel vs Sequential Quicksort
A high-performance comparison between sequential and parallel quicksort algorithms using Python multiprocessing.

📋 Overview
This project benchmarks traditional recursive quicksort against an optimized parallel implementation that uses ProcessPoolExecutor for concurrent sorting.

✨ Features
⚡ Sequential QuickSort - Classic divide-and-conquer implementation

🔥 Parallel QuickSort - Multi-process optimization with configurable workers

📈 Performance Analysis - Tests datasets from 10,000 to 1,000,000 elements

📊 Visual Analytics - Automated charts and CSV export

🔧 Configurable - Easy to adjust workers and dataset sizes
