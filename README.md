# 🚀 PDC Project: Parallel vs Sequential Quicksort

**A high-performance comparison between sequential and parallel quicksort algorithms using Python multiprocessing.**

## 📋 Overview

This project benchmarks traditional recursive quicksort against an optimized parallel implementation that uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for concurrent sorting.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Sequential QuickSort** - Classic divide-and-conquer implementation
- **🔥 Parallel QuickSort** - Multi-process optimization with configurable workers  
- **📈 Performance Analysis** - Tests datasets from 10,000 to 1,000,000 elements
- **📊 Visual Analytics** - Automated charts 
- **🔧 Configurable** - Easy to adjust workers and dataset sizes


## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDC-project.git
cd PDC-project
python quicksort_benchmark.py
