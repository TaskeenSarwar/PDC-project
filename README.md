# 🚀 PDC Project: Parallel vs Sequential Quicksort

**A high-performance comparison between sequential and parallel quicksort algorithms using Python multiprocessing.**

## 📋 Overview

This project benchmarks traditional recursive quicksort against an optimized parallel implementation that uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for concurrent sorting.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Sequential QuickSort** - Classic divide-and-conquer implementation
- **🔥 Parallel QuickSort** - Multi-process optimization with configurable workers  
- **📈 Performance Analysis** - Tests datasets from 10,000 to 1,000,000 elements
- **📊 Visual Analytics** - Automated charts 
- **🔧 Configurable** - Easy to adjust workers and dataset sizes

## 🎯 Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x** - Core programming language
- **Multiprocessing** - Parallel execution framework  
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization and charting
- **Pandas** - Data analysis and CSV handling

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Execution time comparison** - Sequential vs parallel execution times
- **Speedup analysis** - Performance improvement ratios
- **Scalability across dataset sizes** - How performance scales with data volume
- **Worker efficiency metrics** - Processor utilization and efficiency
